    .. warning:: Giskard relies on the robot tracking velocity commands well. Make sure it does!
    .. note::
    Tuning works the following way:
        1. Look at the frequency you get feedback from the robot and choose a frequency slightly below it.
            e.g. joint_states publishes at 100hz -> start with 90hz for the controller.
        2. Leave the prediction horizon unset, so it is derived from the braking time.
        3. If the robot is NOT moving smoothly, increase the braking time until it does.
        4. If Giskard cannot keep up with the frequency, reduce hz and go back to step 2.

    A higher value will result in a more responsive and thus smoother control signal, but the QP will have to be solved more
    often per second. If the value is too low, the QP might start running into
    infeasiblity issues.

    .. note::
    On a real robot:
        Pick a value equal to or below the frequency at which we get feedback.
        Computing control commands at a higher frequency than the robot can provide feedback can result in instability.
        If you cannot match the frequency due to hardware limitations, pick one that is as close to it as possible.
