        Objects are assigned to a layer by clustering their heights, so the layer
        structure comes from the arrangement itself rather than from a fixed assumption
        about how many layers a shelf has.

        Only mesh-centred positions take part. A layer records each object's offset from
        the shelf's own origin, so an uncorrected *shelf* position shifts every offset
        on it, and an uncorrected *object* position shifts that object's own. Unlike the
        object table -- which keeps uncorrected rows and marks them -- layers are
        training data whose whole content is those offsets, so admitting an uncorrected
        one would teach a circuit an arrangement nobody built.

    Orchestrates one run of the sage10k preprocessing pipeline against a pair of

    Mesh measurement has no pass of its own: a source_id names a mesh cached under
    exactly one scene directory (never shared between rooms -- confirmed against the
    live sage10k corpus, see :func:`~experiments.shelf_generation_experiments.utils.build_source_id_to_path`),

    shard's run, and never reports it back to this process or another shard.

    the :class:`ShelfExtractor` each shard groups its shelves with -- never a database
    session or engine: :meth:`_process_objects` delegates to
    :meth:`_process_objects_in_parallel`, which submits :meth:`_process_room_shard` to
    its own worker pool -- each shard builds its own worker-local sessions from
    :attr:`sage10k_database_uri`/:attr:`processed_database_uri` rather than sharing a
    connection held here. :meth:`_process_objects_in_parallel` and
    :meth:`_process_room_shard` read those URIs straight off ``self`` instead of taking
    them as parameters: a bound instance method pickles by pickling the instance behind
    it, and this dataclass holds nothing but plain configuration, so it pickles as
    cleanly as the staticmethods that submit to the same
    ``spawn``-context :class:`~concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`.
