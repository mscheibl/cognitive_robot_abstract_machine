"""
Learn a confidence model over familiar objects and score new ones.

The confidence model is a relational probabilistic circuit fitted per class on the
familiar instances of that class. It answers one question about a new object: how likely
is it under the distribution of familiar instances of its own class. An object whose
likelihood falls below its class's calibrated threshold does not resemble anything the
model was trained on and is judged unfamiliar.
